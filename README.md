# Images to Visio Stencil Maker

This is a PowerShell script to iterate through a directory of images to be used as a stencil within Microsoft Visio. I use it mostly for architecture diagrams when I need to add connectors to my shapes.

The code is simple. Have a look and feel free to modify it for yourself.

If I ever make larger modifications to this code, I will update it here and provide more documentation.
